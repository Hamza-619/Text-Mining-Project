# Text-Mining-Project (University Passau)

This was a group project collaborated with two other fellow candidates.

In this project the aim was to ameliorate the usage of these legal documents with a **two-stage supervised learning** approach for automatically identifying section boundaries and types in appellate briefs. Our approach uses supervised classification in a two-stage process to categorize white-space separated blocks of text. First, we use a **binary classifier** to and section headers. Next, we classify those blocks predicted to be section headers in the first stage into one of section types.
